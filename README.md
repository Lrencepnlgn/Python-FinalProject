# Python-Final-Project
* A final project for the course CS - 121 Advance Computer Programming.
* Submitted to Sir Francis Jesmar Montalbo

## Computer Parts Ordering System 
* This is a system written in Python Programming Language that allows an administrator to manage the ordering process from the user. It is also available to users, allowing them to order computer parts managed by the administrator.


## Console Application 
* This console application includes three functions: order, login, and sign up.
* This console application is coded in Python Programming Language and is an essential resource for users to have access to ordering computer parts.

## Features 
* Feature 1: Allows users to order computer parts. By entering the order name and quantity.

* Feature 2: Allows administrators to access the system.

* Feature 3: Intended for administrators to create a new account in order to access the system.

## To run:
* Open the file named main.py to start the runtime of the system by basically running this file.

* The console application will then appear, along with a screen asking which commands will be used by the administrator, which are Login, Sign up, and Exit.

* After accessing the login screen, the console application will proceed and display the screen for users while the runtime is True.

* The screen will show the choices for users which are the Order Product, View Order, and Exit.

* The console application will ask users whether they want to proceed with the order by simply answering Y or N.
  * Y for a successful order.
  * N for order cancellation.

* If either the administrator or the user enters an invalid value, the console will detect the error and prompt the administrator or user to try again.
