# Python-Final-Project
* A final project for the course CS - 121 Advance Computer Programming.
* Submitted to Sir Francis Jesmar Montalbo

## Computer Parts Ordering System 
* This is a system written in Python Programming Language that allows an administrator to manage the ordering process from the user. It is also available to users, allowing them to order computer parts managed by the administrator.


## Console Application 
* This console application includes three functions: order, login, and sign up.
* This console application is coded in Python Programming Language and is an essential resource for users to have access to ordering computer parts.

## Features 
* Feature 1: Allows users to order computer parts. By entering the order name and quantity.

* Feature 2: Allows users to access the system.

* Feature 3: Intended for administrators to create a new account in order to access the system.

## To run:
* Open the file named main.py to start the runtime of the system by basically running this file.

* The console application will then appear, along with a screen asking which commands will be used by the administrator, which are Login, Sign up, and Exit.

* After accessing the login screen, the console application will proceed and display the screen for users while the runtime is True.

* The screen will show the choices for users which are the Order Product, View Order, and Exit.

* The console application will ask users whether they want to proceed with the order by simply answering Y or N.
  * Y for a successful order.
  * N for order cancellation.

* If either the administrator or the user enters an invalid value, the console will detect the error and prompt the administrator or user to try again.

## Self-Assessment
|Metric| Score| Description|
|:--------:|:----:|:----------------------:|
|Code Reusablity|4|Practices DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself) method excellently, leading to a shorter and cleaner program structure.|
|Maintainablity|3|The program's structure is based on OOP principles, Codes are readable, understandable, aiding to its maintainability.|
|Scalability|3|The program can be easily updated in case of feature add-ons and immediate tweaks.|
|Execution|4|The program is fully functional as declared and intended with additional features that exceeds the requirements of the course. Handling of errors are remarkably done. Some operations even use appropriate algorithms to improve cost-efficiency and overall performance.|
|Originality|3|Concept is quite similar to some samples.|
|Overall Impression|3|Minimal to no bugs or error found during presentation. The overall quality and creativity are good.|
